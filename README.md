# PROJECT 3: HR ANALYTICS
![](https://github.com/trintambogo/portfolio/blob/main/images/promotion.jpg) 
## OVERVIEW
A large MNC company have 9 broad verticals across the organisation. One of the problem they are currently is facing is around identifying the right people for promotion (only for manager position and below) and prepare them in time. Currently the process, they are following is:

1.They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past performance
2.Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical
3.At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 80% are considered) etc., employee gets promotion
For above mentioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. Hence, this company needs help in identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.

To solve this problem i will use predictive analytics in identifying the employees most likely to get promoted.

## SOURCE OF DATA
I got the data from analytics vidhya website

## SKILLS USED
* Cleaned the data was using pandas in python.
* Visualized data using matplotlib and seaborn. 
* Developed decision trees model to identify the employees likely to get promoted.
